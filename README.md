# Strudel Tunes Collection ðŸŽ¶

My personal collection of [Strudel](https://strudel.cc/) tunes for live coding music.

## What is Strudel?

Strudel is a browser-based live coding environment for creating music. It uses a JavaScript-like syntax inspired by TidalCycles to enable dynamic and expressive musical compositions.

## How to Use

1. Head over to [strudel.cc](https://strudel.cc/)
2. Browse the tunes in this repository
3. Copy the contents of any tune file
4. Paste it into the Strudel editor
5. Hit play and enjoy! ðŸŽµ

## Tunes

Browse the `tunes/` directory for all available compositions. Each file contains a standalone Strudel pattern that's ready to play.
